To deploy the secure file-sharing system to production, I would follow these steps:

    âœ… Containerize the app using Docker to ensure environment consistency across development and production.

    âœ… Use MongoDB Atlas as a managed cloud NoSQL database to eliminate the need for self-hosted MongoDB and enhance scalability and security.

    Use the connection string in .env:
        MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/filesharedb

    âœ… Host the Flask application on a cloud platform like Render, Heroku, or AWS EC2 depending on scalability needs and budget. I will configure environment variables like MONGO_URI and JWT_SECRET securely.

    âœ… Serve the app behind Nginx (if not using Render/Heroku), enabling HTTPS via Let's Encrypt SSL certificates to secure communication.

    âœ… Use Gunicorn as the production WSGI server instead of Flaskâ€™s built-in dev server for better performance.

    âœ… Implement rate limiting, input validation, and file type checks to protect against abuse and attacks.

    âœ… Optionally, set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment on every commit.

This approach ensures the app is secure, scalable, and easy to maintain in a production environment.

## Containerization using Docker

Create a `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["python", "run.py"]
